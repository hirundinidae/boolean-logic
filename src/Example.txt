You're about to be tested on your master of boolean logic!
An example of a question you may encounter is: 
Andy had an apple AND Nicole had a peach.
when really, Andy had an orange and Nicole had a pear

This question is asking you to evaluate the statement 
"Andy had an apple AND Nicole had a peach" 
given that Andy had an orange and Nicole had a pear

"Andy had an apple" 
this statement is false because he actually had an orange!
"Nicole had a peach" 
this statement is also false because she actually had a pear! 

Thus, the question is <false statement> AND <false statement> 
an AND operator needs both statements to be true in order for the entire 
expression to be true. 
So the answer to "Andy had an apple AND Nicole had a peach." is FALSE.
